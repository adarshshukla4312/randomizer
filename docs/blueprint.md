# **App Name**: Meow's Selector

## Core Features:

- Team Input: Create a UI component where a user can enter team names. Initially, there should be one input field labeled **Team 1**. Below it, include a button **"Add Another Team"**. Each time the button is clicked, a new input field should appear with the label incremented automatically (**Team 2, Team 3, Team 4...**). The placeholder text of each field should also reflect the team number (e.g., *Enter Team 1 Name*, *Enter Team 2 Name*).
- Pairing Button: "Generate Pairings" button to initiate the pairing process.
- Match Display: Display area showing the generated match-ups in a clear format (e.g., Team A vs Team B).
- Automatic Bye Assignment: If there are an odd number of teams, use AI as a tool to decide, and assign "Bye" to one random team. Make sure that a different team gets a bye each round.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Sporty blue (#4A90E2) to reflect a sense of energy and competition.
- Background color: Soft white (#F7FAFC) to maintain a clean and neutral aesthetic.
- Accent color: A vibrant lighter blue (#7AC1FF) to highlight interactive elements and important information.
- Font: 'Inter', a sans-serif font known for its readability and modern design. This will be used for all text elements in the app.
- Use simple, line-based icons to represent teams or the pairing process. The icons will align with the overall sporty aesthetic.
- A clean and straightforward layout that prioritizes easy team entry and clear display of pairings.
